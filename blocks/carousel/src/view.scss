/* 
 I imported this file in view.js, but was unable to get the styles to import?
 Perhaps my build process was skipping over it? 
 I didn't want to waste time troubleshooting, but it's driving me crazy
 not knowing why it didn't work.

I was able to successful include styling from editor.scss, so that is where
I placed the styling for the carousel widget. This styling is used in both frontend and backend.


I'd love to know why I was unable to include styling here, this is where I would've
liked to place the widget styling. If you have any ideas, please let me know!
