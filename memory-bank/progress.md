># Progress

* **Current Status:** The project exists with a basic structure, build system, and dependencies defined. Version 1.3.0 according to `package.json`. Core PHP classes for API, Assets, Meta, Plugin, and Settings are present. React components for various form elements exist. The Memory Bank has just been initialized and populated with baseline information.
* **What Works:** 
    * Project setup and dependency installation (`make install`).
    * Development server (`make start`).
    * Production build process (`make build`).
    * Plugin packaging (`npm run release`).
    * Basic WordPress plugin structure is in place (`phoenix-press.php`, `includes/`).
    * Frontend build pipeline using `@wordpress/scripts`.
    * Settings page infrastructure likely exists (`includes/Settings.php`, `readme-plugin-settings.png`).
    * Google Analytics `gtag` event tracking (`form_start`, `form_submit`) implemented in `EmbedForm.jsx` and `ConversationalForm.jsx`.
    * Form submission UX updated to show an inline success message (`LOCALIZED.SUBMISSION_MESSAGE`) instead of redirecting in both `EmbedForm.jsx` and `ConversationalForm.jsx`.
* **What's Left:** 
    * Full implementation details of backend logic (API interactions, settings handling).
    * Complete implementation and integration of frontend React components.
    * Defining specific interactions with the Phoenix CRM API.
    * Unit tests (`phpunit.xml` exists, but extent of tests unknown).
    * Detailed documentation beyond the README and initial Memory Bank.
    * Filling in placeholder content in Memory Bank files (e.g., Success Metrics, specific Desired Experience details).
* **Known Issues:** None explicitly documented in `README.md` or inferred yet.
* **Decision Log:**
    * **[Date of Memory Bank Init - e.g., 2025-04-06]:** Initialized Memory Bank structure.
    * **[Date of Memory Bank Init - e.g., 2025-04-06]:** Populated Memory Bank based on `README.md` and `package.json`.
    * **2025-04-06:** Restored `gtag` event tracking (`form_start`, `form_submit`) to `EmbedForm.jsx` and `ConversationalForm.jsx` based on user-provided code snippets, ensuring only tracking logic was reintroduced.
    * **2025-04-06:** Changed form submission behavior from redirecting to displaying an inline success message (`LOCALIZED.SUBMISSION_MESSAGE`) in both `EmbedForm.jsx` and `ConversationalForm.jsx`.
