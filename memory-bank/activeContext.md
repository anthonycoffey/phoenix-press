# Active Context

* **Current Focus:** Updating form submission UX to show an inline success message instead of redirecting.
* **Recent Changes:** 
    * Modified `src/components/EmbedForm.jsx` to remove `window.location.assign` and display `LOCALIZED.SUBMISSION_MESSAGE` upon successful submission.
    * Modified `src/components/ConversationalForm.jsx` to remove `window.location.assign` and use `LOCALIZED.SUBMISSION_MESSAGE` in the final prompt upon successful submission.
    * Created new branch `feature/inline-success-message`.
* **Next Steps:** Update `progress.md` to reflect the changed submission UX. Commit changes to the new branch.
* **Active Decisions:** 
    * Reverted form submission behavior from redirect to inline success message display using `LOCALIZED.SUBMISSION_MESSAGE`.
    * Implemented conditional rendering in `EmbedForm.jsx` to show the message.
    * Updated the existing success prompt in `ConversationalForm.jsx` to use the localized message.
* **Key Patterns/Preferences:** 
    * WordPress plugin structure.
    * PHP for backend/WordPress integration.
    * React (with MUI) for frontend components.
    * `@wordpress/scripts` for build tooling.
    * `Makefile` for orchestrating development tasks (install, start, build).
* **Learnings/Insights:** Gained initial understanding of the project's purpose, core technologies, and development setup from `README.md` and `package.json`.
